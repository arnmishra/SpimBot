For our SPIMBOT strategy, our strategy was to initially solve a certain amount of puzzles. After finding this sweet spot, we start actually catching fruits and smashing them. We simply see the first fruit that is released in the fruit_data array and fixate on it's x and y values and move the bot's x-value until it matches the fruit's x-value. After this, we just simply wait until the fruit falls down. However in order to optimize this feature, we check if the y-value distance between the fruit and the bot is <100, then we move the bot in the y-direction to catch the fruit faster and then go back down to smash it. In addition, we implemented all the Interrupts correctly so whenver a OUT_OF_ENERGY_INTERRUPT fires, we solve the same number of puzzles that we initally did in the beginning to gain an energy boost.
